ðŸŽ¯ Turn Things Off
If you have any tasks running, turn them off. 
If your pipe is running, you should pause it. Using something like: 
alter pipe mypipe set pipe_execution_paused = true;
We will not use the tasks or pipes any more in this course. Instead, we'll talk a little more about data, and then you'll be done. 

ðŸ““ Create a CURATED Layer
Sometimes a Data Engineer's job is done once the data has been enhanced.

In some organizations, anything that involves moving beyond the row level, and into some kind of aggregation or analysis is not the job of a Data Engineer. 

But in some other organizations, a Data Engineer will move data beyond the Enhanced level, into a Curated state. When that happens, the Data Engineer is adding additional processing that may help analysts and data scientists do their work faster, and/or more effectively. 

In this last lesson, we'll be creating some dashboard charts so we can do some light analysis to check data quality. We'll also look at a windowing function that could be used to to roll-up rows into a smaller, more meaningful data set. 

ðŸŽ¯ Create a CURATED Layer
Create a SCHEMA named CURATED in the AGS_GAME_AUDIENCE database.
Make sure the schema is owned by SYSADMIN.

ðŸ““ Snowflake Dashboards
Snowflake has dashboards that can be used to display charts and tables together. These dashboards are not as sophisticated as the ones that can be created with tools like Tableau or Looker, but they can be used for some light analysis on the data. Dashboards are still a new part of Snowflake and many improvements are planned for future releases, but right now they are limited. 

Since Kishore's goal was to load the data and let Agnie analyze her audience, he wasn't asked to take the data any further, but he wants to do some simple data visualizations before he hands to project back to her and allow her to do a fuller analysis. 

ðŸ¥‹ Create a New Dashboard and Add a Tile

ðŸ¥‹ Create a Chart
Remember that clone we made of our original logs_enhanced table? We named it LOGS_ENHANCED_UF and it only had a about a 150 rows in it. We'll use that for our chart. 
*/
select distinct gamer_name, city
from ags_game_audience.enhanced.logs_enhanced_uf;

/*
You can drag the tiles into different positions. You can also do some adjustments on the heights and widths. 

If two Gamer Cities tiles appear on the page -- one with a table and one with the chart -- don't delete the table tile. Instead, right-click on it and choose UNPLACE TILE. 

ðŸ““ So, Where is Agnie's Audience Playing From? 
Most Agnie's gaming audience is in Denver, Colorado, USA. This makes a lot of sense, since Kishore, Agnie and Tsai all live, work and socialize there and have been telling friends and family about their fun project.

Warsaw, Poland is less obvious until Agnie reveals that her aunt, uncle and cousins live in Warsaw. One of her cousins has been promoting the game on a Warsaw Gamers message board. 

Gdansk, Poland is where Agnie's grandparents live.

Kenosha and Sheboygan, Wisconsin, are cities where Agnie grew up and went to college. She posted about her game on her social media accounts, her school friends must have given the game a try!

Tsai's sister is doing a semester abroad in Kenya. 

ðŸŽ¯ Add a Time of Day Chart
Duplicate a tile.
Edit it so that the name is "Time of Day".
Use this code for the query:
*/
select tod_name as time_of_day
           , count(*) as tally
     from ags_game_audience.enhanced.logs_enhanced_uf 
     group by  tod_name
     order by tally desc;     

/*
ðŸ““ Data and Dashboard Limitations
The data being written to the stage files only covers a three-day period, so the fact that our heatmap only has 3 days is not surprising. 

As mentioned earlier, Snowflake Dashboards have room for improvement. For now, we only use them for light analysis, not for production dashboards. 

ðŸ““ What Matters Most?
Kishore has been looking at the ENHANCED_LOGS charts he created and he thinks Agnie will be interested in seeing the charts he created. 

He notices that he's getting two events for every gamer and he doesn't think the actual login and logout data will be very valuable to Agnie, but the total amount of time each gamer played -- a "game_session_length" might be something really interesting and valuable. He wants to see if the time of day a person played the game showed a strong or weak correlation to the length of time they played. 

Even though Agnie hasn't asked for it, Kishore decides to spend a half hour seeing how easy it might be to calculate the session length and analyze it with the time of day labels they assigned.
