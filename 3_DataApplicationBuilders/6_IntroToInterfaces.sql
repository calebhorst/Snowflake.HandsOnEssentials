ðŸ““ Interfaces - More Than Just Faces!
interfaces
Humans often engage in face-to-face interaction. But, of course, the "face" in "interface" doesn't just mean human faces.

The "face" in interface may mean a human's eyes, ears, voice, or hands. The use of scents and the sense of smell will certainly be coming soon as a technical interface, but as yet, is not widely used in consumer electronics and certainly is not available in smartphones right now.

The "face" of an "interface" is any method used by any system to communicate with another system. We use our eyes, ears, and hands to interface with our phones. Our phones use their screens and speakers to interface with us. If we have our phone in our pocket and it vibrates, our thigh might be the interface (see "haptic").

Any way that the phone receives information from us or sends information to us, is an interface. Any way we send information to our phone or receive information from it is an interface.

ðŸ““ Interfaces - The Future
More and more, people are using IOT (Internet of Things) devices to interface with technology in even more exciting ways. We speak to "Alexa", "Siri" and "Cortana" and they talk back to us. We say, "Okay Google, turn on the lights, and activate the evening shades." The shades go down and the lights come on.

Some cars have buzz motors in the driver's seat that buzz your leg when you cross the line without signaling. The future of interfaces is likely to be exciting and a little mind-blowing and Mel and Melanie are here for it!

Mel's father, Igor, doesn't like technology, and he doesn't like change. He's not embracing the changes. Then again, he's happy to use a remote control to change the channel on his TV, and a microwave to pop his popcorn, so maybe it's only the most recent technology that scares him (?!?) He's supposed to use a blood pressure cuff that interfaces with a mobile app that would let him know when his blood pressure is getting too high. He's also supposed to wear a CGM device on the back of his arm but he keeps "forgetting" because he thinks it's all quackery.

Hopefully, he'll stop being such a Luddite and embrace the future, before it's too late!

ðŸ““ Melanie's Favorite Website
Melanie loves to look up foods on the US Government's FoodData Central search engine. She types in a food and hits [Enter] and the website returns a lot of information for her to browse. When she hits [Enter] she is sending a REQUEST. When the website returns the results, it's called a RESPONSE.

The REQUEST and RESPONSE were sent using an internet protocol called HTTPS.

Mel sees his mom using the FoodData Central website all the time. He notices that the REQUEST seems "hackable." He tries to teach his mom to hack the URL to run a variety different searches while bypassing the GUI.

Melanie is not really interested in hacking URLs, but she wants to support her son's tech interests, so she listens while he explains and even agrees to try it a few times. People who like this sort of experimentation tend to make good application developers. People who don't like experimenting with technology often are not interested in tech dev careers.

To give URL hacking a quick try, Melanie goes to https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/ and uses the "Food Data Central" search box. Then, she copies the URL from the results page and pastes it into a new browser window.

ðŸ““ Gooey Things
What is that gooey thing on the bottom of your shoe? Probably chewing gum. What is that GUI thing on your screen? Probably an entry form, with fields, buttons, and other GUI elements.

The term "User Interface" or UI ("yoo-eye") is most often used to refer to the visual interaction point between a human's eyes and the visual presentation of an application. More and more, when speaking of "the UI" we are referring to a page that is rendered in a web browser.

Back in the early 1980s, almost all computer user interfaces were command-line interfaces or CLIs. After the work of Xerox and Apple popularized Graphical Users Interfaces (GUIs) many, many applications began using GUIs ("gooeys").

We often interact with GUIs on our computers and phones. We use GUIs to browse, enter, search, and view information.

Hacking URLs is a very "command-like" task. These commands also look very much like Web Service API commands which you'll be learning more about.

Additionally, GUIs and CLIs have begun to merge. Snowflake's Worksheets are a good example of this. Even though you are entering commands in a GUI, you are entering scripted commands that look a lot like CLI commands. Some new and exciting tools like Docker, DBT and Notebooks involve CLI-type commands entered in GUIs. We live in interesting times.

ðŸ““ Another Interface Type - Application Programming Interfaces
When Melanie searches her favorite website, she interfaces with a GUI. When the GUI interfaces with a database to process her REQUEST and return RESULTS, the website is using an Application Programming Interface(API) to interact with the database.

Notice that the home page of Food Data Central mentions APIs (shown below). The USDA seems to present 3 ways to get access to their data. What are the 3 ways they offer?

ðŸ““  Free Nutrition Data for US Residents
Mel was able to get a Food Data Central API key quickly and easily. But not every learner doing this workshop is from the US, so we don't require you to register for one to complete this workshop.

Before using his FDC key to get FDC data, Mel wants to try using a simpler, food-related API. This one is called Fruityvice (Fruity + Advice? Maybe?) and it doesn't require using an API Key, so it's slightly easier to use (and better for learners not in the US).

ðŸ¥‹  Explore the Fruityvice Website!
Let's explore Fruityvice!! It's a very simple, straightforward way to explore a Web Service API.

After exploring the commands using the interface, copy this command and put it into the address bar of a new browser window.

The first Smoothie Friday was a huge hit! But there were logistical issues. Even though Zena and Mel were there to help Melanie, the kiosk was a bottleneck. Customers kept asking if there was a version of the Smoothie Order Form they could access from their phones.

Melanie promised customers that they would work on making ordering easier, then she asked Zena and Mel to figure out how they could do that. Once they recover from the first Smoothie Friday, they'll start talking about how to solve the ordering bottleneck.
