/*
ðŸ““  What is a Variable?
Variables are used in computing to change values while the code is actually running. 

You can create variables in a Snowflake Worksheet and then use them in other commands, as long as the commands are run from the same worksheet. 

NOTE: A worksheet is considered a "session" in Snowflake.

/*
ðŸ““  What is a Function?
A function is a way to make your code more organized. If you plan to do a certain thing many times, you can put the code into a little module called a FUNCTION. 

To create a function you:

Give it a name.
Tell it what you will be sending to it (if anything).
Tell it what its job or operation is (the code that makes up the function)
Tell it what you want it to send back to you when it's finished (if anything). 
We'll create a simple function that adds three numbers together. Notice that we don't use the $ sign in these next few labs.

ðŸ““  Where Did the $$$'s Go?
We only need the dollar sign symbol when referring to a local variable. 
We don't use them when variables are used in a function, unless, you're using local variables and sending them to the function. 
Compare the code below to the code from the previous lab, above and make sure you understand the difference.

ðŸ““  Snowflake Functions versus User-Defined Functions
Your Snowflake account comes with hundreds of functions already defined. When you define your own functions, you can use the system functions as part of the logic for your user-defined functions! 

You can learn about the various system functions by looking in docs.snowflake.com. 

In the next lab, we'll use a system function called INITCAP() to update a string. INITCAP() reformats any words by making the first letter (the initial letter) a capital letter, and all subsequent letters in the word, lower case.

ðŸ““  Alternating Caps - Neutralized!
People often write phrases in alternating caps to mock a statement being made in a whining or whinging tone. 

Can you create a function that removes the whining tone by converting a phrase from alternating caps to init caps? 

ðŸŽ¯ CHALLENGE LAB:  Write a UDF that Neutralizes Alternating Caps Phrases!
Your function should be in the UTIL_DB.PUBLIC schema. 
Your function should be named NEUTRALIZE_WHINING
Your function should accept a single variable of type TEXT. It won't matter what you name the variable.
Your function should return a TEXT value. 
The value returned should be in formatted so that the first letter of each word is capitalized and all other letters are lower case. (HINT: Use INITCAP() in your function code with your variable name inside)
Test your code and make sure it works, because on the next page, you'll need to prove it works!
