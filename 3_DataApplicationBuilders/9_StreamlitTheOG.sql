ðŸ““ Good Developers Aren't Afraid of Error Messages
We see it often in our intro course - some learners collapse in a heap of helplessness the first time they get an error message. If you want to be a developer, you can't freak out every time you see an error message. Error messages should not be scary.

Read them. They won't make perfect sense, but if you can find two or three words in a row that make some sense, you can probably start making your way through.

Snowflake mods can't possibly troubleshoot the machine, internet, firewall, and account of every user, so we don't try. We give you simple steps, with lots of check points and we give you discussion boards. But, you have to solve your own problems - there is no other way to become an good developer.

So, when you see an error message. Take a deep breath in, exhale out, read the error message, and get to work solving this moment's particular puzzle.
