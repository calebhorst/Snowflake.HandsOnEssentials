/*
ðŸŽ¯ Check Your Warehouse 
You should know how to complete the tasks below in Snowflake (because you've completed Badges 1 and 2!)  
All Trial Accounts should come with an XS Warehouse named COMPUTE_WH. Sometimes this is not the case. Please take a moment to check and make sure you have a COMPUTE_WH warehouse and check that SYSADMIN owns it.

    - If you don't have the COMPUTE_WH warehouse, please create it. 
    - If the warehouse is owned by ACCOUNTADMIN, change the ownership to SYSADMIN

ðŸŽ¯ Create a Smoothies Database
    - Create a new database in your trial account.
    - Call it SMOOTHIES.
    - Make sure it is owned by the SYSADMIN Role. 
- The PUBLIC schema will also need to be owned by SYSADMIN. 

ðŸŽ¯ Configure Your User Profile
    - Click on the up arrow next to your name in the bottom-left corner of the main screen.
    - Choose My profile.
    - Set your default role to SYSADMIN (if needed).
    - Set your default warehouse to COMPUTE_WH (if needed).
    - In the Notifications section, check the box that will make sure you get emails when a resource monitor wants to alert you.

ðŸŽ¯ Create a FRUIT_OPTIONS Table
- Create a table called FRUIT_OPTIONS in the PUBLIC schema of your SMOOTHIES database.
- Make sure it owned by the SYSADMIN Role. 
- The table should have two columns:
    - First column should be named FRUIT_ID and hold a number. 
    - Second column should be named FRUIT_NAME and hold text up to 25 characters long.
