 ðŸ““ An Indispensible Tool for Builders - The GitHub Account!
GitHub is like Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter because GitHub is (among other things) a Social Network!

Just as Facebook is used to share personal info and ideas with personal friends, Reddit is used to share topical ideas with topic-interested sub-reddit users, and LinkedIn is used to share professional info with professional contacts, GitHub is a way to share code with coder friends!

What makes GitHub really confusing (it can be SO confusing) is that it is also a version management system. You not only store and share code, but people can ask for and get copies of your code and add to it. In this course, we'll not be doing any real version management or sharing of code with others, but we'll need a GitHub account to serve as a back end for a Streamlit (SniS) app.

Streamlit requires you to have a GitHub account. 

You are not REQUIRED to create a new GitHub account, but Streamlit will REQUIRE you to link your app to a GitHub account. If you already have a GitHub account you like to use, you can use that GitHub account. However, if you do not have a GitHub account, or don't feel certain that you want to link the code from this workshop  to your "real" GitHub account, you can use any GitHub account you want - new, old or otherwise. 

ðŸ§°  Create a GitHub Account (Optional)
If you don't have a GitHub account or you have one, but don't want to use it for this workshop, you'll need to create a GitHub account that can be used for this workshop.

Go to github.com to start. Choose the Free Account if that is your preference.
