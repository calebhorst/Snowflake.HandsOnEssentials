 ðŸ““ An Indispensible Tool for Builders - The GitHub Account!
GitHub is like Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter because GitHub is (among other things) a Social Network!

Just as Facebook is used to share personal info and ideas with personal friends, Reddit is used to share topical ideas with topic-interested sub-reddit users, and LinkedIn is used to share professional info with professional contacts, GitHub is a way to share code with coder friends!

What makes GitHub really confusing (it can be SO confusing) is that it is also a version management system. You not only store and share code, but people can ask for and get copies of your code and add to it. In this course, we'll not be doing any real version management or sharing of code with others, but we'll need a GitHub account to serve as a back end for a Streamlit (SniS) app.

Streamlit requires you to have a GitHub account.

You are not REQUIRED to create a new GitHub account, but Streamlit will REQUIRE you to link your app to a GitHub account. If you already have a GitHub account you like to use, you can use that GitHub account. However, if you do not have a GitHub account, or don't feel certain that you want to link the code from this workshop  to your "real" GitHub account, you can use any GitHub account you want - new, old or otherwise.

ðŸ§°  Create a GitHub Account (Optional)
If you don't have a GitHub account or you have one, but don't want to use it for this workshop, you'll need to create a GitHub account that can be used for this workshop.

Go to github.com to start. Choose the Free Account if that is your preference.

ðŸ““ Changes Needed When Moving from SiS to SniS
The biggest differences between SiS and SniS are:

1) How users connect to your app.
2) How you connect your app to Snowflake.

With SniS, users will be able to connect to your app more easily. You can set up your SniS app in a way that doesn't require them to log in or have a USER in your Snowflake account. In fact, Streamlit will host your app for free if you make it open to the public.

Connecting your app to Snowflake is less easy in SniS than it was in SiS. In SiS, the connection happened automatically. In Streamlit, we'll need to carry out a number of steps.

We'll begin by making a few changes to the streamlit_app.py file in your GitHub Repo.

DO NOT EXPECT THE APP TO WORK RIGHT AFTER THESE CHANGES. WE HAVE NOT SET UP A STREAMLIT ACCOUNT YET AND WE HAVE NOT ASKED YOU TO RUN THE APP YET.

ðŸ¥‹ Make Updates to the streamlit_app.py File
DO NOT EXPECT THE APP TO WORK RIGHT AFTER THESE CHANGES. WE HAVE NOT SET UP A STREAMLIT ACCOUNT YET AND WE HAVE NOT ASKED YOU TO RUN THE APP YET.

ðŸŽ¯ Edit the requirements.txt File
Modify it so it looks like this:

DO NOT EXPECT THE APP TO WORK RIGHT AFTER THESE CHANGES. WE HAVE NOT SET UP A STREAMLIT ACCOUNT YET AND WE HAVE NOT ASKED YOU TO RUN THE APP YET.  YOU ARE JUST TRANSITIONING THE CODE FROM INSIDE SNOWFLAKE TO OUTSIDE OF SNOWFLAKE IN THESE FEW LABS. */

ðŸ““ Rinse & Repeat
Because the process of making change and viewing the changes repeats over and over, we will not show every step in the process. Instead, we'll show code changes and the results you can expect to see.

Click the edit button. Make Edits. Commit changes. Switch tabs. View results. Switch back.
Here is an example of another Streamlit App (not our project) and the workflow between GitHub and Streamlit.  We will put this into action using our project in the next lesson.
