ðŸ¥‹ Look at the Parquet Data
Run a select, then click on any row to see it's data. Is this data nested?

Write a more sophisticated query to parse the data into columns. We give you the first two rows. We know you can figure out the rest.

Knowing what you do about Denver, Colorado's approximate longitude and latitude, do you see any issues with this data?  People who work as data professionals should constantly look at their data and question whether it is making sense. In this case, we see some issues. One of our jobs is to massage and cleanse the data as we get it ready to for use by others.

ðŸ¥‹ Use a Select Statement to Fix Some Issues
According to some online blog posts, you don't need more than 8 decimal points on coordinates to get accuracy to within a millimeter. Remember that Latitudes are between 0 (the equator)  and 90 (the poles) so no more than 2 digits are needed left of the decimal for latitude data.

Longitudes are between 0 (the prime meridian) and 180. So no more than 3 digits are needed to the left of the decimal for longitude data.

If we cast both longitude and latitude data as NUMBER(11,8) we should be safe.  We have included the code for this select statement below.
