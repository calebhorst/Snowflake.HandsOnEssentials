ðŸ¥‹ OpenStreetMap - Super Charged! 
Did you notice that both WKT Playground and the GeoJSON.io site use OpenStreetMap to display the data? OpenStreetMap is an open source alternative to Google Maps that can be very handy for getting geospatial data displayed. Mel considers whether he should somehow try to extract all the data from OpenStreetMap and make it available in his Snowflake Account. 

OpenStreetMap data is free for use. So he is free to download it to his laptop and upload it into a cloud account. Then again, downloading and prepping the data could take awhile. He tells Klaus about his idea.

Klaus tells him that Open Street Map data is probably already available on the Snowflake Data Marketplace and encourages Mel to check out a company called Sonra that enhances Open Street Map data, and makes it available on the Marketplace. Klaus advises that Mel can spend days getting the raw data ready himself, or he can have more than he needs within minutes. 

NOTE: You will need to switch your role to ACCOUNTADMIN to get the share added to your trial.

ðŸ““ Variables are Cool, But Constants Aren't So Bad!
Variables can come in very handy! They can give you the power to write a snippet of code that can be used in a variety of situations. You just change what you put into the Variables and Voila! a new answer comes out. 

That said, the opposite of Variables, called Constants, aren't so bad either. After all, there will always be 360 degrees in a circle and  Ï€  will always start with 3.14. 

So if we want to, when calculating the distance to Melanie's Cafe, we can use constants for those coordinates, instead of variables. 

ðŸ““ Let's Create a UDF for Measuring Distance from Melanie's CafÃ©
Melanie's CafÃ© isn't a real place but Mel's app will need to do a LOT of calculations with that fictional location in mind. Maybe it would make sense to create a Function (defined by us, the Users, not Snowflake) that we can refer to.

When a user defines a function it's called...you guessed it... a User-Defined Function (or UDF). 

You can create UDFs in a variety of languages but we'll stick to SQL for now. 

Create a second Schema in Mel's Database and call it LOCATIONS. Make sure it is owned by SYSADMIN.  

We need to give our UDF a name, so how about DISTANCE_TO_MC (for Distance to Melanie's CafÃ©). 

We need to pass in the point we want to measure the distance FROM. We'll call that the "location" and shorten it to "LOC". So we'll pass in LOC_LAT as the Latitude and LOC_LNG as the Longitude.

ðŸ¥‹ Filling in the Function Code
The first point in the distance function will be based on the fictional location for Melanie's Cafe. It's a CONSTANT.  Figure out what constants you need to replace the ?s with.

The second set of numbers will be sent into the function as variables. 

The distance will be returned.

ðŸ““ Why Not Use the UDF We Just Created? 
Since the Sonra data is not separated into Latitude and Longitude, it would be hard to use our function. Our function expects the two coordinates to be passed in separately, and the Sonra data has each point stored as full geoJSON GEOGRAPHY objects in the COORDINATES column. 

We could try to parse the COORDINATES column back into Latitude and Longitude numbers. If we did that, we could pass them into our UDF where the UDF would to reassemble them back into a POINT again. That would work. But there's a better way!

We need a function that can accept the Sonra GEOGRAPHY object instead of two numbers.

ðŸ““ What the Heck is Going On? 
First we had a function called DISTANCE_TO_MC and it had two arguments. Then, we ran a CREATE OR REPLACE statement that defined the DISTANCE_TO_MC UDF so that it had just one argument. Maybe you expected only one function called DISTANCE_TO_MC would exist after that. But you look in your LOCATIONS Schema under FUNCTIONS and you find that there are two!
If you are new to coding, you may not know about something called "overloading" a function. Overloading sounds like a bad thing, but it's actually pretty cool. 

Basically, it means that you can have different ways of running the same function and Snowflake will figure out which way to run the UDF, based on what you send it. So if you send the UDF two numbers it will run our first version of the function and if you pass it one geography point, it will run the second version. 

This means we can run the function several different ways and they will all result in the same answer.  When speaking about a FUNCTION plus its ARGUMENTS we can refer to it as the FUNCTION SIGNATURE.

ðŸŽ¯ Create a View of Bike Shops in the Denver Data
Mel is thinking it might make sense to do a cross promotion with bike shops. He needs to find all the bike shops in the Denver data as a first step. Can you help?

Create a view that pulls all the bike shops in Denver into a view called DENVER_BIKE_SHOPS. Make sure the view is in the LOCATIONS schema and is owned by SYSADMIN. 

HINTS: 

There are 33 bike shops in the data set right now. (This may vary over time but should not vary by a LOT.)
You can find the shops in either the V_OSM_DEN_SHOP_OUTDOORS_AND_SPORT_VEHICLES or the V_OSM_DEN_SHOP table. The benefit of using the more specific view is that the columns included are more directly related to a bike shop. 
You can use a WHERE <column> = 'bicycle' -- you just have to figure out which column.  This is the ONLY thing you need in the WHERE clause. It's a much simpler view definition than the one we used for smoothie shops!
Be sure to include a column called DISTANCE_TO_MELANIES that calculates the distance to Melanie's CafÃ© for each Bike Shop
