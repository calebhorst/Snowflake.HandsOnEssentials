ðŸ““ Knowing WHEN to Leave Data Where It Lands
So, if we can reach through our External Stages and access data where it is, without loading it into tables, why don't we ALWAYS do that?

And if we shouldn't ALWAYS do that, how will we know when to LEAVE IT (and not load it) and when NOT to LEAVE IT (and instead, load it)?

This is not easy to answer. The answer will depend on a lot of factors. For now, we can show you HOW to leave the data where it lands, even though we can't answer the WHENs and the WHYs for you. 

leave it where it lands

In this lesson, you'll learn different things you can do  with data even when you don't load it. We'll call it "non-loaded" so that we can separate the concept of data that is loaded into Snowflake and then output back into a stage using an "unload" process. This data that is NEVER loaded, we'll call "non-loaded." 

ðŸ¥‹ List Commands Versus Select Statements 
Run a list command on the @PRODUCT_METADATA Stage. 

You can do this either by setting the worksheet context to ZENAS_ATHLEISURE_DB.PRODUCT and running:
list @product_metadata;

or you can run:
list @zenas_athleisure_db.products.product_metadata;

How many columns are there, and how many rows (files)?

USE ROLE sysadmin;
LIST @zenas_athleisure_db.products.product_metadata;

/*
ðŸ““ Simple Selects on Non-Loaded Data
We've done this before in other workshops. Remember that we can query data in a file, before we even load it. Let's explore the 3 flat files in the PRODUCT_METADATA stage. 

We're going to use a select statement on files in the @PRODUCT_METADATA Stage We can't run a select star - it won't work for data that hasn't been loaded.

Since we know very little about the structure of the files, let's just see what appears in the first column ($1) of each file. 

ðŸ¥‹ Query Data in the ZMD 
select $1
from @product_metadata; 

How many rows did you get back? And can you make any sense of them?  

ðŸ““ One File at a Time?
Can you modify the select statement so it only queries one file at a time? Pick a file name from the LIST command, and try to change your SELECT statement so it only queries the data from one of the 3 files.

Try it, and then go to the next page to see how we wrote our query. 

HINT: Add a / after the stage name and type in one of the fllenames.

/*
ðŸ““ What is Going On Here?
The data looks really weird, right? 

Snowflake hasn't been told anything about how the data in these files is structured so it's just making assumptions.  Snowflake is presuming that the files are CSVs because CSVs are a very popular file-formatting choice. It's also presuming each row ends with CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) because CRLF is also very common as a row delimiter.

Snowflake hedges its bets and presumes if you don't tell it anything about your file, the file is probably a standard CSV.

By using these assumptions, Snowflake treats the product_coordination_suggestions.txt file as if it only has one column and one row. 

ðŸ““ How Can We Tell Snowflake More about the Structure of Our File?
Of course you know the answer because we've been using File Formats since Badge 1.

We need to create some File Formats to help guide Snowflake in handling these files.
*/

/*
ðŸ““ Wait, I Still Don't Know What's Going on in This File!
We need to create some File Formats to handle these files, but no one has told us how the files are set up!

This is actually really common when you work with data - you get a file and you actually have to look at it and try to figure out what's going on.

So, you open the file in good text editor and look at it (you can see what we saw, below). 

Okay, there are carets (^) in this file. What are they doing? Are they separating each row?

We can learn about our data by trying out some different file format settings. Let's create a quick file format and see how the data looks when we use it with our SELECT statement. 

ðŸ¥‹ Create an Exploratory File Format
Let's create a file format to test whether the carets are supposed to separate one row from another.  We'll name our file formats starting with "ZMD" for "Zena's Metadata"?

We created zmd_file_format_1 as an exploration. Then we created zmd_file_format_2 as another "guess."

We'll keep file format 3 around and use it anytime we want to query the "product coordination suggestions" file.

Some issues are resolved but others are not!

We're going to fix the issues shown with the green rectangles in the next lab! Look back at the image of the raw file near the top of this page. What do you think is causing those? It can't be spaces because if it was, our TRIM_SPACE file format property added to the file format would have fixed them.

ðŸ¥‹ Dealing with Unexpected Characters
Many data files use CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) as the record delimiter, so if a different record delimiter is used, the CRLF can end up displayed or loaded! When strange characters appear in your data, you can refine your select statement to deal with them. 

In SQL we can use ASCII references to deal with these characters. 

13 is the ASCII for Carriage return
10 is the ASCII for Line Feed
SQL has a function, CHR() that will allow you to reference ASCII characters by their numbers.  So, chr(13) is the same as the Carriage Return character and chr(10) is the same as the Line Feed character. 

In Snowflake, we can CONCATENATE two values by putting || between them (a double pipe). So we can look for CRLF by telling Snowflake to look for:

 chr(13)||chr(10)
