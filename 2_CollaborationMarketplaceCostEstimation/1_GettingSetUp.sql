-- Keeping Track!
/*
This workshop has a lot of characters and 3 different companies. We are starting out in our labs as if we are Martín, who works as a Data Extract Administrator at World Data Emporium (WDE).

Later, you will pretend to be other characters, at other companies and things might get a little confusing. To help you stay oriented, we suggest that you edit your current profile to make your trial account appear as if it is a World Data Emporium account.

It won't seem necessary now, but believe us when we say that later, you will be glad you did.

In the next set of labs, think of yourself as Martín, working for World Data Emporium.
