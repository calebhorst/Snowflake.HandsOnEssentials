-- Using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA to Query Metadata
The word "metadata" means "data about data." 

The INFORMATION_SCHEMA that gets created in every Snowflake Database holds metadata. In other words, it holds statistics about the number of databases, schemas, tables, views and more. It also holds data about the object names and other object details. 

Notice that in all the queries above, we are using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA to double-check our work and make sure we completed the tasks correctly.
